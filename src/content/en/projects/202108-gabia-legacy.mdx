## Overview
Modernized Gabia's legacy PHP systems and improved the team's development environment and monitoring processes.

### Domain Operations System Revamp (2021.08 ~ 2022.12)

Back-office development with PHP CodeIgniter, Java Spring MVC, Oracle, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue

**Key Issues**
- Business logic tightly coupled with UI in PHP/jQuery scripts, including direct DB access from View layer (Smart UI)
- Legacy back-office built on PHP4 violating ISMS audit requirements
- CSS and HTML styles with unclear ownership

**Approach**
- First migration to MVC pattern based on CodeIgniter, Vue 2, Vuex, Axios
- Separated backend API based on Spring MVC / JPA
- Vue 2 → 3 migration and TypeScript adoption after Vue 3 official release
  - Options API → Composition API migration
  - State management library Vuex → Pinia migration

**Process**
- Could not separate auth API from company-wide common admin server due to lack of authority
  - Existing admin server called new server via proxy, forwarding IP and auth information
  - Used Spring filter to extract auth information from incoming requests into objects, injected into controllers when business logic required authentication
- Applied Atomic Design Pattern
- Introduced Swagger and Vue Query to minimize boilerplate code for repetitive API → axios client patterns

**Results**
- Fulfilled ISMS audit compliance requirements for personal information
  - Implemented audit trail for changes handling personal information and products
- Separated admin page frontend / backend
  - Configured layout templates and components that can be easily referenced without prior Vue knowledge
- Replaced CSS and improved markup through Quasar UI framework adoption

### Domain Registry Communication Daemon Improvement (2023.10 ~ 2024.01)

RPC server development with Java 21, Spring Webflux, RSocket, Protobuf

**Key Issues**
- Legacy daemon server over 10 years old
- Request/response interfaces and policies hardcoded as String Vectors per registry
- EPP sessions managed with HashMap without concurrency considerations
- OOM errors during traffic spikes due to inherently slow EPP communication

**Approach**
- Introduced Interface Definition Language (IDL)
  - Evaluated OpenAPI Specification, Protocol Buffer, Flat Buffer
  - Chose Protobuf for sub-1MB request sizes, broader development compatibility, and future gRPC potential
- Selected internal bidirectional communication protocol
  - Evaluated gRPC vs RSocket → chose RSocket for active Spring ecosystem support and direct TCP-layer connectivity beyond WebSocket
  - Used Spring Boot's RSocket dependency since rsocket-rpc was effectively unmaintained
- Built TCP-based socket server with Spring RSocket communicating via Protocol Buffers
  - Reactive stack deemed more appropriate than WebMVC-based Spring Integration TCP gateway, given the focus on I/O with overseas registry servers without DB connections or business logic
- Implemented session pool based on Apache Commons Pool
- Leveraged Java 21 Virtual Threads for reactive programming integration with existing blocking libraries

**Process**
- Removed blocking code using Blockhound
- Handled unavoidable blocking functions with `Mono.fromCallable(blockingFn).subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())`
  - Enabled JDK 21 Virtual Threads (reactor.schedulers.defaultBoundedElasticOnVirtualThreads=true)
- Separated session acquire → use → release concern into AOP, inspired by @Transactional
  - Storing session in singleton container would reduce usable sessions to one
  - Considered Spring WebMVC + ThreadLocal vs Spring Webflux + Context differences
  - Implemented custom Context-based AOP since RSocket bypasses WebFilter

**Results**
- Eliminated hardcoded request/response arrays through IDL adoption
- Resolved OOM errors under load and dramatically increased concurrent throughput (200 → 200,000)
- Established team load testing process through nGrinder documentation and result reporting

---

## Development Environment Improvements
- Code structure improvement: hexagonal architecture, multi-module design, monorepo adoption
- Established load testing with nGrinder
- Introduced API documentation automation (Springdoc, OpenAPI Generator)
- Set up PHP Composer autoload and Xdebug
- Introduced Spring Batch
- Improved Sentry alerting
- Contributed MR templates and project technical documentation
