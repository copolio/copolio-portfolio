## Project Overview

Developed a WebSocket-based real-time chat platform as a personal project. Designed for stable message delivery even under high concurrent connection loads.

## Key Responsibilities

### Server Architecture
- Designed and implemented WebSocket gateway based on NestJS
- Implemented message synchronization across multiple server instances using Redis Pub/Sub
- Built chat history storage and pagination API using MongoDB

### Client Development
- Developed TypeScript-based React client application
- Applied optimistic update pattern to improve UX
- Implemented offline message queuing and automatic sync on reconnection

### Infrastructure
- Set up local development environment using Docker Compose
- Created load testing scenarios using k6 for performance measurement

## Achievements

- Achieved support for 10K concurrent users (verified via k6 load testing)
- Achieved sub-50ms message delivery latency
- Achieved 99.5% WebSocket connection stability (24-hour continuous test)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Large-scale Concurrent Connections
- **Problem**: Performance degradation when exceeding 5K concurrent connections on a single NestJS instance
- **Solution**: Applied horizontal scaling architecture based on Redis Pub/Sub with sticky sessions for connection distribution

### Message Ordering
- **Problem**: Message ordering not guaranteed in multi-server environment
- **Solution**: Applied Snowflake ID-based message sorting and server timestamp synchronization
