## Overview
Developed and operated multiple domain registrar services at Gabia's Domain Business Team. Managed services across the entire domain lifecycle including registration, renewal, reservation, cancellation, and modification.

---

### Domain Creation Service (2023.12 ~ 2024.01)

AI-powered domain recommendation service built with TypeScript, Next.js 14, Chakra UI, and ChatGPT

**Key Issues**
- Choosing between Assistants API vs Chat Completions API
- Fixing LLM output format consistency
- Serverless function timeout (~10s) on Vercel free tier

**Approach**
- Prompt engineering based on Chat Completions API
- Separated loading UI using Suspense
- Prototyped with Next.js serverless functions instead of building a separate backend

**Process**
- Adjusted temperature (1.0 → 0.9) to improve response format consistency
- Reduced generation array size to handle Vercel free tier timeout (max 10 seconds)

**Results**
- Completed PoC for AI utilization in Gabia's domain services
- Provided improvement direction for domain search service

### Domain Reservation Unified Search / Order Service (2023.08 ~ 2023.09)

REST API built with Java Spring MVC, JPA, Oracle / Frontend with PHP CodeIgniter, JavaScript, jQuery

**Key Issues**
- Unified search across domain drop-catch/reservation products existed, but combined checkout in a single order was impossible
- Pessimistic DB locks only on users during orders → intermittent concurrency issues
- Codebase scattered across multiple monolithic services
- Magic constants hardcoded in PHP/JavaScript frontend scripts without TypeScript support
- Fragmented AJAX calls per client type (web, mobile)

**Approach**
- Built Spring MVC REST API, back-office, and frontend to enable unified ordering across different reservation products
- Replaced DB locks with Redis multilock on customer and requested domain list to improve data consistency and prevent duplicate reservation orders

**Process**
- Added fallback to DB pessimistic locking when Redis is down
- Unified to a single API that responds with client-type-specific messages based on server-side parameters
- Increased user latency due to additional HTTP API communication layer compared to legacy code that directly accessed DB from frontend PHP server

**Results**
- Consolidated scattered code into a single Spring MVC microservice, clearing technical debt
- Refactored magic constants to enums and JSDoc for improved readability and maintainability
- Applied functional programming paradigm using Lombok's toBuilder for Copy-On-Write, Functional Interface, Lambda, and Stream API to minimize side effects and improve code readability

### Domain Registration Change / Cancellation Service (2023.04 ~ 2023.08)

REST API built with Java Spring MVC, JPA, Oracle / Frontend with PHP CodeIgniter, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS

**Key Issues**
- Domain registration cancellations/changes were manually processed on weekdays through customer center inquiries
- Unavoidable losses when processing was impossible due to weekend requests or registry maintenance
  - Domains can be fully refunded if cancelled within the grace period

**Approach**
- Applied event-driven pattern using Kafka to automate domain deletion and refunds within the registration grace period
- Applied CQRS pattern by separating change eligibility queries from domain change service
- Added web page features based on legacy AngularJS and Fetch API using markup provided by the frontend team

**Process**
- Failed to properly understand the manual refund process used by the operations team during planning, leading to schedule delays
- Was overly accommodating during negotiations, resulting in scope creep — ended up handling all frontend work and payment debugging despite separate responsible departments

**Results**
- Dramatically reduced operations team workload of 100+ daily manual processes
- Applied Composer autoloading in CodeIgniter for Value Object usage and debugging improvement
- Improved PHP debugging/profiling process through Xdebug adoption

### Expired Domain Parking Service (2022.09 ~ 2022.12)

REST API built with Java Spring MVC, JPA, MySQL / Back-office with TypeScript Vue

**Key Issues**
- Domains available during recovery period even after expiration
- Third-party parking service discontinued due to contract expiration
- Parking skin management page with inconsistent encoding depending on access path
- Poorly maintained REST Docs-based API documentation

**Approach**
- Parked expired domains to self-hosted nameserver landing pages to encourage renewal and reservation
- Developed expired domain parking conversion/recovery RESTful API with Spring MVC and JPA
- Fixed Korean character encoding issues by fixing encoding to UTF8 on new skin creation
- Migrated documentation from Spring RestDocs to Springdoc-based OpenAPI

**Process**
- Achieved 100% API documentation for Spring-based APIs
- Migrated legacy parking skin management system to TypeScript SPA with Vue 3 and Ant Design Vue
- Improved development productivity through OpenAPI Generator and Vue-Query adoption

**Results**
- Increased expired domain renewal rate by 20%

---

### KR Domain Reservation Service (2022.09 ~ 2022.11)

REST API and batch scripts built with PHP CodeIgniter and Oracle

**Key Issues**
- KR domains registered with Gabia still required competitive acquisition through registries after expiration during reservation
- CodeIgniter framework (v3 and below) that loaded libraries at runtime via text-based resolution, defeating IDE code navigation and making debugging difficult

**Approach**
- Developed internal reservation service for KR domains
- Encouraged renewals through email notifications to existing owners upon reservation orders

**Process**
- Introduced PHPDoc and added annotation files for CI core to improve type hinting and code readability across the legacy PHP project

**Results**
- Increased KR domain renewal rate by 10%
- Improved KR domain reservation success rate
