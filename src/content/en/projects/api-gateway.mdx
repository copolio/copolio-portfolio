## Project Overview

Developed a high-performance open-source API gateway in Go to address the high cost and limited customization of commercial API gateway solutions.

## Key Responsibilities

### Architecture Design
- Designed a plugin-based middleware chain architecture to modularize features such as authentication, rate limiting, and logging
- Implemented gRPC-based internal communication protocol for efficient data exchange between microservices

### Performance Optimization
- Achieved 3x throughput improvement through connection pooling and keep-alive optimization
- Minimized memory allocation using sync.Pool to reduce GC overhead
- Implemented distributed rate limiting with Redis to ensure consistency across cluster environments

### Open Source Management
- Established contribution guidelines and code review processes
- Configured CI/CD pipeline (automated testing and releases via GitHub Actions)

## Achievements

- Achieved 100K requests per second processing (benchmark)
- Earned 500+ GitHub stars with 10+ external contributors
- Deployed to production environment, reducing infrastructure costs by 40% compared to commercial solutions

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### High Availability
- **Problem**: Risk of total traffic disruption on single gateway instance failure
- **Solution**: Achieved 99.9% availability through health-check-based automatic failover and circuit breaker pattern

### Dynamic Routing Performance
- **Problem**: Performance degradation with thousands of routing rules
- **Solution**: Implemented Radix Tree-based routing algorithm achieving O(log n) complexity
