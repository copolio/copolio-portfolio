Server engineer who designs payment system reliability and drives user growth on top of it.

At Karrot Pay, rapidly expanding across payment/settlement infrastructure, escrow, offline payments, and gift shop services — designing improvements users actually feel, grounded in funnel and CS data analysis. Contributed to +271% escrow transaction volume growth and +104% new offline payment user acquisition. Previously at Gabia, led systematic modernization of PHP legacy systems into Java/Spring-based MSA with hexagonal architecture and event-driven patterns.

Designs beyond feature delivery — incorporating incident response, settlement, and operations into the architecture, while accelerating team velocity through runbooks and integration documentation.
